As an offshore engineer, I should be able to create a terraform module for deploying a VPC, then research on if this code can be deployed via Git Lab.

VPC Configuration:

2 private subnet

Create RT and RT association

1 local route and the other route goes to nat gateway.

NAT Gateway

Other basic VPC configuration as well

IAM User

Admin Permissions



Acceptance Criteria:

Module is created for VPC and IAM

A Code is ready to deploy the VPC and IAM user using the modules created

Research is done on how to deploy the code from GitLab to AWS.
